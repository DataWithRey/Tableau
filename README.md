This study delves into the infrastructure and resources dedicated to mental health care. It examines the availability of health units, mental hospitals, and human resources such as social workers and mental health professionals in various regions. Furthermore, it assesses the effectiveness of these facilities in providing timely and quality care to individuals with mental health needs.
Crucially, this analysis also considers the prevalence of suicide across different age groups and countries. By examining crude suicide rates, it seeks to understand the magnitude of this public health issue and identify populations at heightened risk. 

Additionally, it explores whether individuals receive adequate treatment for mental health disorders, shedding light on gaps in access to care and opportunities for intervention.
Through this multidimensional approach, we aim to paint a comprehensive picture of the global mental health landscape. By assessing the availability and effectiveness of mental health services and examining suicide rates and treatment utilization, we seek to inform policy and practice initiatives that promote mental well-being and ensure equitable access to mental health care for all individuals, regardless of geographic location or demographic characteristics.
